1. what is SSR?
   Server-side rendering is when content on our webpage is rendered on the server and not on our browser using JavaScript.
   
2. why we are using SSR?
   Server-side rendering (SSR) means that the content of our site is generated on the server, then sent to the browser. 
   This is useful for search engine optimization(SEO) purposes, because search engines can "see" the content of your site
   before they send it to users.

3. what is CSR?
   In client side rendering (CSR), we are completely running ReactJS on the browser.
   The initial HTML rendered by the server is a placeholder and the entire UI is rendered in the browser once all our scripts load.
   
4. What is the difference between SSR and CSR?
   The main difference between SSR and CSR is where the page is rendered.
   SSR renders the page on the server-side and CSR renders the page on the client-side.
