#React

# What is React?
React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single-page applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components

#How does React Work?
React creates a virtual dom in memory
and React only changes what needs to be changed.
Insted of manipulating the browser Dom directly it will create a virtul dom and where it does all the manipulation 
before make changes to browser DOM 

#What is ES6?
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.
like most of the browser has not support the advance version of js to handle this behaviour we use ES6.

#What is Classes in React?
A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it,
we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.
Example :- class Car {
             constructor(name) {
             this.brand = name;
            }
           }
Note :- while using classes in react we have to write class name in uppercase.
        The constructor function is called automatically when the object is initialized.
        
#What is Class Inheritance in React?
To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.

Example :- class Car {
             constructor(name) {
               this.brand = name;
             }

             present() {
               return 'I will buy ' + this.brand;
             }
          }

          class Model extends Car {
          constructor(name, mod) {
          super(name);
          this.model = mod;
         }  
         show() {
              return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
           }
         }
        const mycar = new Model("Thar", "Mustang");
        mycar.show();
        
//output :- I will buy Thar it is a Mustang.

Note :- The super() method refers to the parent class.
        By calling the super() method in the constructor method,
        we call the parent's constructor method and get access to the parent's properties and methods.

#Array methods in React?
1.Map
  The .map() method allows us to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result.
  In React, map() can be used to generate lists.
  Example :- const myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
             const myList = myArray.map((item) => <p>{item}</p>)

#What is Destructuring?
lets understand the destructuring with the help of example like ,if i want to make a sandwhich can i get every indegrient which present
in firdge? ans is no i will chosed which i like.  same with the destructuring it will only select some items from array or object.

Example :- #Destructuring with array.
           const sandwhich = ['carrot', 'onion', 'Tomato' , 'cabbage' ];
           const [item1 , item2 , item3 , item4] = sandwhich;
           //let say i want only cabbage and tomato what i will do???
           const [ , , item3 , item4 ] = sandwhich;
           
Note :- When destructuring arrays, the order that variables are declared is important.

           #Destrucuting with object
           const sandwhich = {
               item1: 'carrot',
               item2: 'Tomato',
               item3: 'cabbage',
               item4: 'onoin'
           }
           mySandwhich(sandwhich);
          function mySandwhich({item1, item3, item2, item4}) {
          const message = 'I am making sandwhich ' + 'in which' + item1 + item3 + ' is  there' + 'but' + item2 + item4 + 'is not there.';
         }

#What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

#What is React Components?
Components are independent and reusable bits of code and it returns HTML.
There are two type of components
           _______________|________________
          |                               |
   Class Components                   Function Components  
   it use class keyword               it used function keyword
   it returns html                    it also returns html  
   need extends React.Component       less code 
   also render() method,              easer to understand
Example :-                             Example :-
class Car extends React.Component {     function Car() {
render() {                                      return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
 return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;              }
 }
}
Note :- creating a React component, the component's name MUST start with an upper case letter.

######################################--------React Class Components--------################################### 

#what is components?
Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML through a render() function.

#Class Component
 component's name must start with an upper case letter.
 include the extends React.Component statement(inheritance)
 requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.
 
 Example :- Create a Class component called Car
            class Car extends React.Component {
            render() {
                      return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                     }
              }
            //output :- Hi, I am a Car!
            
#What is Component Constructor?
If there is a constructor() function in our component, this function will be called when the component gets initiated.
In React, component properties is kept in an object called state.

Example :-
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class Car extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super(); 
      this.state = {color:"red"};
    
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>I am Driving {this.state.color} Car</h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

#Props in class component?
Another way of handling component properties is by using props.
Props are like function arguments, here we can send them into the component as attributes.

Example :-
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class Car extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>I am Driving {this.props.color} Car</h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

//in aap.js file :-  < Car color="red" />
Note :- here we have to write this.props.state 


#How to use Props in the Constructor??
If our component has a constructor function, the props should always be passed to the constructor 
and also to the React.Component through the super() method.

Example :- 
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class Car extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  } 
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am Driving {this.props.model}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

//in render method :-    < Car model="Thar" />

#How to use Components in Components??
We can refer to components inside other components:

Example :- 
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Food extends React.Component{
  render() {
    return(
      <>
      <h1>I Like to eat every Sweet, specially Soanpapri,gulabjamun,kajukatli and every thing </h1>
      </>
    )
  }
}

export default class Car extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Food />
        <h2>I will go by my own Thar</h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}


//in app.js :- inport main component i.e <Car />


#What is React Class Component State?
React Class components have a built-in state object.
The state object is where we can store property values that belongs to the component.
When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

Example :- 
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class Car extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      material:"aalo,pani,papari",
      step1 : "papri",
      step2 : "aalo chatni",
      step3 : "pani",
      step4 : "so tasty"
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>HOW TO MAKE GUPCHHUP ?</h1>
        <h4>
          First of all take {this.state.material} and step1 first take {this.state.step1} , hole them add some 
          {this.state.step2} inside puri then add some {this.state.step3} and eat it. It is {this.state.step4}
        </h4>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

// in app.js :- <Car />


#Changing the state Object
To change a value in the state object, use the this.setState() method.
