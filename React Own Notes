#React

# What is React?
React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single-page applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components

#How does React Work?
React creates a virtual dom in memory
and React only changes what needs to be changed.
Insted of manipulating the browser Dom directly it will create a virtul dom and where it does all the manipulation 
before make changes to browser DOM 

#What is ES6?
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.
like most of the browser has not support the advance version of js to handle this behaviour we use ES6.

#What is Classes in React?
A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it,
we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.
Example :- class Car {
             constructor(name) {
             this.brand = name;
            }
           }
Note :- while useing classes in react we have to write class name in uppercase.
        The constructor function is called automatically when the object is initialized.
        
#What is Class Inheritance in React?
To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.

Example :- class Car {
             constructor(name) {
               this.brand = name;
             }

             present() {
               return 'I will buy ' + this.brand;
             }
          }

          class Model extends Car {
          constructor(name, mod) {
          super(name);
          this.model = mod;
         }  
         show() {
              return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
           }
         }
        const mycar = new Model("Thar", "Mustang");
        mycar.show();
        
//output :- I will buy Thar it is a Mustang.

Note :- The super() method refers to the parent class.
        By calling the super() method in the constructor method,
        we call the parent's constructor method and get access to the parent's properties and methods.

#Array methods in React?
1.Map
  The .map() method allows you to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result.
  In React, map() can be used to generate lists.
  Example :- const myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
             const myList = myArray.map((item) => <p>{item}</p>)

#What is Destructuring?
lets understand the destructuring with the help of example like if i want to make a sandwhich can i get every indegrient which present
in firdge? ans is no i will chosed which i like same with the destructuring it will only select some items from array or object.

Example :- #Destructuring with array.
           const sandwhich = ['carrot', 'onion', 'Tomato' , 'cabbage' ];
           const [item1 , item2 , item3 , item4] = sandwhich;
           //let say i want only cabbage and tomato what i will do???
           const [ , , item3 , item4 ] = sandwhich;
           
Note :- When destructuring arrays, the order that variables are declared is important.

           #Destrucuting with object
           const sandwhich = {
               item1: 'carrot',
               item2: 'Tomato',
               item3: 'cabbage',
               item4: 'onoin'
           }
           mySandwhich(sandwhich);
          function mySandwhich({item1, item3, item2, item4}) {
          const message = 'I am making sandwhich ' + 'in which' + item1 + item3 + ' is  there' + 'but' + item2 + item4 + 'is not there.';
         }
