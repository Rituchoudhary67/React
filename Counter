Que1. how to make counter with the help of react

basic things require while making this assignment:- index.html,index.js,counter.js(which we will make )

Step1 :- first thing make one js file in src section (example :- counter.js <---file name) 

step2 :- In index.html file looks like
        <title>React App</title>
        <html>
        <body>
            <div id="root"></div>
            <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
       </body>
       </html>
    
Step3 :- In index.js file select the html element by selectors the file looks like this

        import React from 'react';
        import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
        import Counter from './counter';      ----------this is important in that we are inporting Counter file

        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
        root.render(
        <div>
             <h1>hello</h1>
             <p>i am ritu learning react</p>
             <Counter/>                    ----------this is the main step in that we are adding the componet
       </div>
       );
Step4 :- In counter.js file we have to add import react and export default function the file looks like this

       import React from "react"          ----importing react componet
       export default function Counter() {       -----making one function for counter

       let [count,setCount] = React.useState(0);    ---here we r using useState which is a Hook, it allows us to allows us to track                                                              state in a function component(that means when we have to change the                                                                    text,updating it in tha case we are use this because its normally is not updating

       function increase() {                  -----logic for increasing 
        setCount(count + 1);
       }
       function decrease() {                   -----logic for decreasing 
         setCount(count - 1);
       }
      function restart() {                    ------it allways ste zero[0]
        setCount(count = 0);
      }
      return (
      <div>
           <p>{count}</p>                                                -----here the number is going to display
           <button onClick={increase}>Increase Count</button>            -----onClick event for clicking the button
           <button onClick={decrease}>Decrease Count</button>
           <button onClick={restart}>Restart</button>
      </div>
     )
    }
